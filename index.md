# Description

In this workshop you’ll cover a series of modules that guide you 
from understanding an analytics workload, using the Team Data 
Science Process, the Cortana Intelligence Suite Platform, the 
foundations of data transfer and storage, data source 
documentation, storage and analytics processing using various 
tools in a comprehensive solution. You’ll learn how to work 
through a real-world scenario using the Cortana Intelligence Suite
tools, including the Microsoft Azure Portal, PowerShell, and Visual 
Studio, among others. You'll learn how to leverage the Cortana 
Intelligence Solution Portal to rapidly deploy a pre-configured 
solution, and you'll learn how to modify a solution for a real-
world implementation.

This course is designed to take approximately one to two days, 
depending on what is covered and how many of the labs are done 
in-class. The longer course is marked (Extended Class). All 
materials are provided regardless of the length of the course. 


# Details

## Intended Audience:

Technical professionals (Data Scientists, Database Professionals, Analysts, BI Professionals) who are familiar with building solutions but not familiar with the entire CIS Platform of products. 

## Course Level

Intermediate

## Title:
Building Solutions with the Cortana Intelligence Suite

## Prerequisites

There are a few things you will need in order to properly follow the course materials:

A subscription to Microsoft Azure (this may be provided through your company or as part of your invitation – you must have this enabled prior to class – you will be using Azure throughout the course, for all labs, work and exercises). You can use your MSDN subscription – https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/memberoffers/msdn-benefits/, your employer may provide Azure resources to you, but make sure you check to see if you can deploy assets and that they know you’ll be using their subscription in the class. 

A laptop capable of using the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) - all lab work will be done on the Microsoft Azure Windows Data Science Machine.
